# The tests in this directory were imported from the tests Presentation/CSS/
# in the W3C MathML test suite, adapted and converted into reftests.

# not imported: maction, merror, msqrt

# Some of the original == tests use mphantom to hide some parts of the formula
# but unfortunately the spaces produced are detected. To preserve the same
# rendering, vertical and horizontal alignments have been added.

# Also, the original author sometimes says "Right hand side of equation should
# look like mirrored copy of left hand side". To convert these tests into
# reftest, the experimental CSS "transform" property has been used. However,
# the tests and references do not seem to match exactly (errors in the tests
# and/or bugs in MathJax?). These tests are disabled for now.
