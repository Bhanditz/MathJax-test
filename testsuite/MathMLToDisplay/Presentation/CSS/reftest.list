# The tests in this directory were imported from the tests Presentation/CSS/
# in the W3C MathML test suite, adapted and converted into reftests.

# not imported: maction, merror, msqrt

# Some of the original == tests use mphantom to hide some parts of the formula
# but unfortunately the spaces produced are detected. To preserve the same
# rendering, vertical and horizontal alignments have been added.
